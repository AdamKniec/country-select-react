## Tech Stack
- SCSS
- Styled Components
- React
- Fetch API

(I considered using Redux to manage the state, however this App is rather small and I will probably not add new features in the future so that's why I decided to use just React with component level state :) Further commits on this app will be mostyl related to refactoring.)
## toDo
- Refactoring
- Adding tests
- Adding prop types
